# Ghastly Plots
Or Spectral Plots :)


## Game Description
Game created for [Warsaw Film School Game Jam Pro](https://fb.me/e/2hQ7t8JPE), Game Jam theme: `What Is Real?`.
Our spin at this theme, was to not reveal to the Players which characters they are actually playing, and constantly question themselves: "What is my actual (Real) character? And who is the Real oponent?".
Play as one of the ghosts, and figure out which character you are, while at the same time hiding from your oponents! Disintegrate other lost souls on the map, but be careful not to Vaporize your own character!

Game is designed to be played with Xbox Controllers (tested on 360 and Xbox One), by 2 players (can be extened up to four).
During the gameplay, your character *WILL NOT* be highlighted or revealed to you. You can however select any character for elimintation (coloured outline). Whenever a player gets killed, he will Posses a new character immediately, until there are no more characters left standing.

## Game Aim
